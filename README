Appengine Datastore Query Test
------------------------------

(See COPYING for license terms. This code is MIT-licensed.)

This repository contains a barebones appengine Python app (py-load) to
seed the datastore with 2000 records and then run a few queries of
1000 records to measure query performance.

The repository also includes a minimal appengine Java app (java-load)
to query 1000 records (previously inserted by the Python app) and
measure query performance.

Query performance measures just a few (5) samples, so this is not
statistically rigorous. It does serve to get a rough picture of
relative performance.

I focus primarily on query performance here because that's the number
of interest to me. It's relatively easy to work around slow inserts
and deletes; less easy to work around slow queries.


Python app
----------

To try the Python app, edit app.yaml to point to an appengine app you
own and use `appcfg.py update py-load` to upload it.


Java app
--------

To try the Java app, edit build.xml and point it at your appengine
Java SDK, edit WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml and point the application at
the app you want to deploy to, then run `ant && appcfg.sh update war`


Inserting Records
-----------------

The Python app's landing page has a button to insert 2k records of an
entity that looks like this (no fields indexed):

Person
======
firstname (length 8)
lastname (length 8)
address (20)
city (10)
state (2)
zip (5)

I recognize this is a toy model; the intent is merely to compare the
relative performance of Java and Python for medium-large datastore
queries.
